  paragraphs:
  - Boil was arrested and executed.
  - "But I can\u2019t shake the feeling that justice wasn\u2019t truly served."
  - "I made the call\u2014I chose them. And yet, something keeps gnawing at me, like
    I sent the wrong person to the grave."
  - "How can I keep calling myself a detective, knowing I handed down a sentence
    that might\u2019ve belonged to someone else?"
  - I made up my mind to finish out the year. Then I turned in my badge to the Chief
    and walked away for good.

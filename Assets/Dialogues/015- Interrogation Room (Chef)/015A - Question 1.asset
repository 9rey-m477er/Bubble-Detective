  paragraphs:
  - Where were you at 8 PM?
  - I was closing up shop.
  - Really? That's not what Chef Flay was saying.
  - He said he saw you leave shortly after your friend left his shop.
  - '!!'
  - So you did leave your shop. Why?
  - I was mad that Popp went to Chef Flay, knowing I can't stand the guy.
  - Went over to talk to him about it, but in the end, it didn't matter. We're good
    now.

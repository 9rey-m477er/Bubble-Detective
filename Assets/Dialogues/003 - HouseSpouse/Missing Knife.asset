  paragraphs:
  - I see there's a knife missing, Ms. Dishopp. Know anything about it?
  - Chef Boil Hardee has it.
  - And this person is?
  - My husband's best friend. Popp told me that Hardee needed to borrow a knife.
  - Don't know why Hardee didn't just get one from his house instead of taking one
    of ours.
  - Though he said that Popp had a specific knife that he needed to use for his shop,
    so I don't know.
  - Thanks for the information.
  - '(That is weird. I''m gonna have to walk to Chef Boil Hardee at some point.)

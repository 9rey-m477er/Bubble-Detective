  paragraphs:
  - What's a fish hook doing on the ground?
  - Could be Popp's. He was at the annual fishing competition yesterday.
  - Does he compete every year?
  - Yes, for 10 years and always brings home the prize winning fish.
  - Has he always fished?
  - No, the only time he fishes is at the competition.
  - Though I feel bad for his other friend who always competes.
  - Why do you feel bad, and who is this friend?
  - Bubba T., and Popps met him at the first fishing competition he competed in.
    And boy were they competitive.
  - Guy's been fishing for 30 years. Every day in fact, and has won all the competitions.
    It's his whole job to fish.
